# Warning
Today is Sat 4 Mar 2022, I accidentally push assignment 4 into this commit name called "Done the sort thing" and I have no idea how to fix this. If P'TA or whoever comes to check this assignment, I apologize to you but please check my second last commit. (Notice that the result of the second last commit and the current commit is pretty similar if you don't mind the commit time, you can check this one instead.)

Sorry for the inconvenient.


# Concept
My concept is to separate a new requirement function into several Classes which has a similar to the old one but since I want it to be a pattern, not just an algorithm so I decided to make more classes since I wanted to make an admin has the same value as a student because if I want to make a student become an admin in one day so I change the old function into a parent class and make a new one to inherit from the parent class which has several things to change.

What does it look like when running the code?
if you run the program, There will be a lot of things that appear so here is a quick guide.
First, the program will ask you to choose what roles you want to be, there will have 5 choices which are<br>
`RA:` Register as Admin<br>
`LA:` Login as Admin<br>
`RS:` Register as a Student<br>
`LS:` Login as a Student<br>
`E:` Exit<br><br>
If you choose one of them, it will ask you for the user information such as Name, IdNumber, and ContactNumber, After you fill it in the right input format which I won't detail of it. It will lead you to the normal menu that can modify a student but one thing different is menu number 8. which going to lead you to the menu that can modify admin's information.<br>

Note that in this assignment, the Student will be no longer doing anything of the CRUD is for only admin to manage.
